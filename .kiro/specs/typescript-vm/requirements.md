# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a complete virtual machine (VM) in TypeScript that executes bytecode produced by a custom high-level programming language. The system includes a full language toolchain from source code to execution, encompassing language design, frontend parsing, compilation, bytecode generation, and runtime execution with supporting tooling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write programs in a simple high-level language with expressions, functions, and control flow, so that I can create readable and maintainable code that runs on the VM.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write source code THEN the language SHALL support arithmetic expressions with operators (+, -, *, /, %)
2. WHEN I write source code THEN the language SHALL support variable declarations and assignments
3. WHEN I write source code THEN the language SHALL support function definitions with parameters and return values
4. WHEN I write source code THEN the language SHALL support function calls with argument passing
5. WHEN I write source code THEN the language SHALL support conditional statements (if/else)
6. WHEN I write source code THEN the language SHALL support loop constructs (while/for)
7. WHEN I write source code THEN the language SHALL support boolean expressions and logical operators
8. WHEN I write source code THEN the language SHALL support string literals and basic string operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my source code to be parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), so that the compiler can understand and process the program structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN source code is provided THEN the lexer SHALL tokenize the input into a stream of tokens
2. WHEN tokens are provided THEN the parser SHALL build an AST representing the program structure
3. WHEN parsing encounters syntax errors THEN the parser SHALL provide meaningful error messages with line numbers
4. WHEN the AST is created THEN it SHALL accurately represent all language constructs
5. WHEN the AST is created THEN it SHALL be traversable for code generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the compiler to generate bytecode from my source code, so that the VM can execute my programs efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AST is provided THEN the compiler SHALL walk the tree and emit corresponding bytecode
2. WHEN generating bytecode THEN the compiler SHALL optimize simple expressions where possible
3. WHEN generating bytecode THEN the compiler SHALL handle variable scoping correctly
4. WHEN generating bytecode THEN the compiler SHALL generate proper jump instructions for control flow
5. WHEN compilation fails THEN the compiler SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a VM implementer, I want a well-defined bytecode format, so that the execution engine can reliably interpret and execute programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bytecode is generated THEN it SHALL consist of opcodes with their operands
2. WHEN bytecode is generated THEN it SHALL support stack operations (push, pop, dup)
3. WHEN bytecode is generated THEN it SHALL support arithmetic operations (add, sub, mul, div, mod)
4. WHEN bytecode is generated THEN it SHALL support comparison operations (eq, ne, lt, gt, le, ge)
5. WHEN bytecode is generated THEN it SHALL support control flow operations (jump, jump_if_false, call, return)
6. WHEN bytecode is generated THEN it SHALL support variable operations (load, store)
7. WHEN bytecode is generated THEN it SHALL be serializable to binary or text format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the VM to execute bytecode programs correctly, so that my programs produce the expected results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bytecode is provided THEN the VM SHALL execute instructions sequentially
2. WHEN executing THEN the VM SHALL maintain a stack for operand storage
3. WHEN executing THEN the VM SHALL maintain a call stack for function calls
4. WHEN executing THEN the VM SHALL manage variable storage and scoping
5. WHEN executing THEN the VM SHALL handle arithmetic operations correctly
6. WHEN executing THEN the VM SHALL handle control flow correctly
7. WHEN runtime errors occur THEN the VM SHALL provide meaningful error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a programmer, I want access to standard library functions, so that I can perform common operations like printing and mathematical calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing programs THEN I SHALL have access to a print function for output
2. WHEN writing programs THEN I SHALL have access to basic math functions (abs, sqrt, pow)
3. WHEN writing programs THEN I SHALL have access to string manipulation functions
4. WHEN writing programs THEN I SHALL have access to type conversion functions
5. WHEN using standard library functions THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with the language

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tooling support, so that I can develop, debug, and test programs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing THEN I SHALL have access to a REPL for interactive programming
2. WHEN debugging THEN I SHALL have access to a disassembler to view bytecode
3. WHEN debugging THEN I SHALL have access to an assembler to write bytecode directly
4. WHEN developing THEN I SHALL have access to a test framework for validation
5. WHEN debugging THEN I SHALL have access to a debugger with breakpoints and step execution
6. WHEN using tools THEN they SHALL provide clear and helpful output

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling throughout the system, so that I can identify and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN syntax errors occur THEN the system SHALL report the error location and nature
2. WHEN compilation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages
3. WHEN runtime errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide stack traces and context
4. WHEN type errors occur THEN the system SHALL identify the conflicting types
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL not crash but handle gracefully
